MK6 - This is an Indian avatar of the 'Makree' so we found no better name to call him MK and sufficed a 6 to denote his 6 legs. You can even modify him to be an 8 legged robotic spider. MK6 is able to simulate physical leg movement in sycronisation and do acts like dance, waving to a crowd or just walking around. The alogorithm uses a PID control (Propotonal integral derivative) to control the 6/8 servos attached to the arduino uno microcontroller. MK6 also used a servo controller board which makes coding and configuartion of the robot very easy. MK6 is the ideal mid range robot if you have already made simple robots like obstacle avoidance and line followers.MK6 needs to be powered by high torgue servos and each leg needs 3 servos i.e first servo attached to the body, second to the leg and third to the claw. So MK6 has 6 legs X 3 = 18 DOF (degree of freedom). You may reduce it to 2 servos per leg with tweak in design by MK6 will then loose abaility for complex moves like a dance. MK6 is powered by two battery sources - one for the servo controller which provides power to servo and other for arduino.
